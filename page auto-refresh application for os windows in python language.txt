In order to create an auto-refresh application for Windows using Python, you can use a library called "tkinter", which is a built-in Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces. To start, create a new Python file and import the tkinter and webbrowser libraries. Then, create a new class and a function that loads the webpage and refreshes it every few seconds. Here is an example code:```pythonimport tkinter as tkimport webbrowserimport timeclass RefreshPage: def __init__(self, url, refresh_rate): self.url = url self.refresh_rate = refresh_rate self.root = tk.Tk() self.browser = None self.create_browser() def create_browser(self): self.browser = tk.Canvas(self.root, height=500, width=800) self.browser.pack() self.load_url() def load_url(self): if self.browser: self.browser.destroy() self.browser = tk.Canvas(self.root, height=500, width=800) self.browser.pack() self.browser.create_text(400, 200, text="Loading Page...") self.browser.update() webbrowser.open(self.url) time.sleep(self.refresh_rate) self.load_url() RefreshPage("https://www.google.com", 10)```In this example code, we have created a class called "RefreshPage" with two parameters: "url" and "refresh_rate". The "url" parameter specifies the website you want to refresh, while the "refresh_rate" parameter specifies how often you want to refresh the web page (in seconds).The "create_browser" function creates a canvas and loads the specified webpage. The "load_url" function refreshes the webpage every few seconds using the "webbrowser" library.Finally, we create an instance of the "RefreshPage" class with the URL and refresh rate of the webpage we want to auto-refresh.That's it! You can customize this code to suit your needs and use it to auto-refresh any webpage you want.
